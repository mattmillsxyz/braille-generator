# Braille Generator

This is a very basic application to convert text to braille code.

## Running the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Features

### Implemented

- Type in text and have it displayed on screen in braille
- Download the braille code as a png image

### To Be Implemented

- Download the braille code as svg

## Known Issues

- Empty image download on Android. Image is downloaded, but does not contain braille text.
- I'm currently using the Apple Braille font. I think there's probably a better way to do this to make it more transferrable. Maybe using unicode, not sure.

## Why?

In my other life, I create digital artwork (like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Brne-SzBkHq/)). I wanted a quick way to add the title of the artwork using braille code to give it a more interesting look.
